## Visualizing the invariant representations

In addition to quantitative results, we also analyse the cluster of z and z_tilde embedding generated by the model. Since these embeddings are generated in higher 
dimension, we reduce the dimension to 2 using tSNE, then plot using matplotlib. 

The model outputs the z and z_tilde embeddings in the form of z.pth and z_.pth files. To be able to plot the embeddings using Matplotlib, you must first convert the embeddings into NumPy array. The extractVectores.py files helps you to do just that. It takes the path to the z and z_tiles PyTorch .pth location, converts them into NumPy arrays and saves them as .npy files in the specified location. Follow the steps below to visualize the embeddings. 

# Step 1:

To extract the .npy files, this run the following command:
```
python extractVectors.py --path <path to torch embeddings .pth files> --save <.npy save file path> 
```

Please note the the above code allows you the extract one experiment ata time. Please modify the code to suit as per your need. 

# Step 2:

Run the visual.ipynb with apropriate locations to get the visualization.


Following are two examples:

tSNE plot of z:

tSNE plot of z_tilde:

Once the .npy files have been created. Run visualization.py code preferably in Jupyter Notebook to do the final visualization.
