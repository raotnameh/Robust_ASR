## Visualizing the invariant representations

In addition to quantitative results, we also analyse the cluster of z and z_tilde embedding generated by the model. Since these embeddings are generated in higher 
dimentions, we reduce the dimension to 2 using tSNE, then plot using matplotlib. Following are two examples:

tSNE plot of z:

tSNE plot of z_tilde:

To run get the above plots, you must first extract the embeddings from torch output and convert into Numpy array. To do this run the following command:
```
python extractVectors.py --path <path to torch embeddings> --path-aug <augment path> --save <np Numpy array save file path> --batchsz <batch size of embedding>
```


Once the .npy files have been created. Run visualization.py code preferably in Jupyter Notebook to do the final visualization.
