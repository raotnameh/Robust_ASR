HE QUICKLY PULLED HIS HANDS AWAY
GIVE ME THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE
HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE
HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WRONG
HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCHEMIST
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO COME DOWN AND GET YOU
THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD
THEY'D NEVER LET YOU GO
IF I COULD I'D WRITE A HUGE ENCYCLOPEDIA JUST ABOUT THE WORDS LUCK AND COINCIDENCE
I SHALL MAKE US SOME ICE CUBES
I WAS TORN BETWEEN FEAR AND CURIOSITY
THE DESERT DIDN'T ANSWER HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS
THIS IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION SHELDON SAID
I AM PROUD OF YOU HE SAID
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME THE SUN ASKED
THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
YOU'D BETTER TAKE IT EASY
HOW DO YOU THINK THE TABLE LOOKS
BUT WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME WHO GOES OUT
WHERE ARE YOU FROM THE BOY ASKED
I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
WHY WAS IT THAT HE WANTED THE BOY TO SERVE AS HIS INSTRUMENT
OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
I'M AFRAID IT'LL BE STEVE TINA
THE TREES SWAYED UNIFORMLY IN THE BREEZE
YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
THE BOY REMINDED THE OLD MAN THAT HE HAD SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HIDDEN TREASURE
GOING UP TO SEE ERIN
I THOUGHT TONIGHT I'D PUT MISS KELLY THERE
IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIEDUP LAKES
THEY HAVE THEIR EYES GLUED ON HIS FACE
THE AIRPLANE ROSE GRACEFULLY INTO THE SKY
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED
THAT FIRST DAY EVERYONE SLEPT FROM EXHAUSTION INCLUDING THE ENGLISHMAN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
I FOUND THESE ONE DAY IN THE FIELDS
STARTING WITH HIS OWN
HELP ME THE BOY SAID
WHY SHOULDN'T I MAKE FATHER MY BENEFICIARY
I'LL SEE YOU GET IT IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
MY FREEZER CONTAINS ENOUGH FOR A BANQUET
I HAD TO TEST YOUR COURAGE THE STRANGER SAID
THINK I'LL GO HOME AND SEE WHAT THE FAMILY IS DOING
ALWAYS ASK AN OBJECTIVE QUESTION
FIRST THEY TRIED TO FIND HIM ON THEIR OWN
YOU'RE THROUGH DECIDING ANYTHING
I'M LOOKING FOR A TREASURE SAID THE BOY AND HE IMMEDIATELY REGRETTED HAVING SAID IT
IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
CURSE THE MOMENT I MET THAT OLD MAN HE THOUGHT
CAN I SEE BLOOD ORGY OF THE LEATHER GIRLS AT A MOVIE HOUSE
IT DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING
HE WAS MORE CERTAIN OF IT THAN OF ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
I'M AFRAID THAT IF MY DREAM IS REALIZED I'LL HAVE NO REASON TO GO ON LIVING
I KNOW WHY I WANT TO GET BACK TO MY FLOCK HE THOUGHT
MAYBE HE'LL GIVE US ONE
MR LEE CAN'T BE BOTHERED NOW
FEW PEOPLE REALISE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
THE HORIZON WAS TINGED WITH RED AND SUDDENLY THE SUN APPEARED
BUT MY HEART IS AGITATED THE BOY SAID
IT'S IN ALL THE AFTERNOON PAPERS
YOU HAVE BEEN A REAL BLESSING TO ME
I DIDN'T FALL IN
IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
WAIT TILL THOSE TWO FUTURE JAILBIRDS READ THE MORNING POST TOMORROW
I CAN SEE APRIL COMING
THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZE I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE
THAT'S ALMOST A HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK
THE MEN FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION
ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
I WANT MY HUSBAND TO WANDER AS FREE AS THE WIND THAT SHAPES THE DUNES
IF WE SERVE TEA IN CRYSTAL THE SHOP IS GOING TO EXPAND
AS FAST AS I CAN
YOU'D THINK I WAS ON THE WITNESS STAND
SHE PLACED THE GLASS CAREFULLY ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE
THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS
WE'VE BEEN FED BALONEY SO LONG WE'RE GETTING USED TO IT
THE BOY BEGAN TO DIG INTO THE DUNE
I'LL COVER THE METHOD I USE AND DESCRIBE SOME ALTERNATIVES
WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP OUR CLUB
THE STEEL OF ITS BLADE GLITTERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
HERE I AM BETWEEN MY FLOCK AND MY TREASURE THE BOY THOUGHT
ALMOST EVERYONE HERE SPEAKS SPANISH
YOU FIGHT IT CUT
BUT YOU WILL LOVE HER AND SHE'LL RETURN YOUR LOVE
THE THIEF WASN'T THERE AND THE OWNER BROUGHT HIM A CUP OF TEA
IT WAS THE OLD MAN WHO SPOKE FIRST
YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR FEARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST IN A STRANGELY GENTLE VOICE
NIGHT FELL AND AN ASSORTMENT OF FIGHTING MEN AND MERCHANTS ENTERED AND EXITED THE TENT
THE DESERT TAKES OUR MEN FROM US AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS RETURN SHE SAID
I HAVE TO FIND A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO WITH ME
ABOUT TIME ONE OF YOU LUNKHEADS SAID IT
CAN I HELP YOU ASKED THE MAN BEHIND THE WINDOW
HE ALMOST BEGAN TO TELL ABOUT HIS TREASURE BUT DECIDED NOT TO DO SO
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
I AM DEFINITELY OPEN TO THE IDEA BECAUSE IVE ALWAYS WANTED TO WORK AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER
YOU'RE HERE RATHER EARLY
THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHEMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
I READ ONLY WHAT THE BIRDS WANTED TO TELL ME
MAYBE NO ONE HERE KNOWS WHAT AN ALCHEMIST IS
IT WAS AN ELEMENT OF HER SEXUALITY
MEN DREAM MORE ABOUT COMING HOME THAN ABOUT LEAVING THE BOY SAID
TO STUFF INTO THEIR OWN POCKETS
I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
WHO'D YOU SAY IT WAS
THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
READING BETWEEN THE LINES REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING
AND WHAT DO YOU DO IN SALEM HE INSISTED
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
MY DOG GAVE HER LIFE TO SAVE MY CHILD
THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
THE SHEEP HAD TAUGHT HIM THAT
THE SUN THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE
I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD CREATE A CONCISE TABLE
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANY CLEANING HE SAID
KIDNEYS ARE TRANSPLANTED OFTEN BECAUSE EVERY HEALTHY PERSON HAS TWO OF THEM
WHERE SHE USED TO LIVE
THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
I WANT TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO
THEN IT BECAME A SIGNAL OF DANGER
THEY REACHED THE CENTER OF A LARGE PLAZA WHERE THE MARKET WAS HELD
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
I'VE BEEN ALL OVER TOWN
TWINS ARE KNOWN TO BE CONFOUNDING
MY KEYBOARD IS FILLED WITH DUST
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND FRENCH
THE REFERENCES ARE GOOD IN THE VERY NARROW AREA OF HISTOGRAM METHODS
I AIN'T GONNA SQUEAL
I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
SANDRA READ ALOUD THE STRANGE EXCERPT
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FOR MYSELF
HOW DO YOU DO
HE ONLY LOST THREE BUTTONS OFF HIS VEST
WATER BOARDING IS A TERRIBLE FORM OF TORTURE
YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE
FROM HERE ON YOU WILL BE ALONE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
I JUST KNOW THAT THE TRADITION IS ALWAYS RIGHT
WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
I'VE LEARNED THINGS FROM THE SHEEP AND I'VE LEARNED THINGS FROM CRYSTAL HE THOUGHT
DID YOU EVER WALK INTO THIS OFFICE
JUST WHAT IS THE LOWDOWN ON WILLIAMS
THEY BECOME THE SOUL O F THE WORLD
USING SCRIPT BLOCKERS IS GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA BUT IT REQUIRES THE USER TO LEARN A BIT
IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANY ALTERNATIVE SEARCH ENGINES JUST GOOGLE THEM
YOU FORGOT TO PACK IT
IT SEEMS OLD AND WISE
SO HE BEGAN TO WANDER THROUGH THE CITY AND FOUND HIMSELF AT THE GATES
WHICH ONE OF THESE MEN IS IT
THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
HE HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE SOMEONE AS CAPABLE AS HIS PREVIOUS APPRENTICE
YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR ME THE LAST TIME
I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
ANY DECENT EDITOR CAN SHOW YOU LINE NUMBERS AND LET YOU JUMP TO A SPECIFIC LINE
THAT GUY OVER THERE LIKES TO DRINK A LOT TALK A LOT BUT DO NOTHING
LET'S DANCE
ALL THINGS ARE ONE
BUT WHERE ARE THE HOUSES
AND SO DO I
PUTTING A POOL UNDER THIS FLOOR WAS A GREAT IDEA
HOW COULD IT BE AWKWARD
WHATEVER THE THING OBSERVED ONE COULD FIND A CONNECTION WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENT
THE SAME HAND THAT HAD BRANDISHED THE SWORD NOW HELD A WHIP
THE YOUNG ARAB TOOK OUT A BOOK AND BEGAN TO READ
HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND
BUT THEN I REALIZED SHE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
THE JACKET HAD A PURPOSE AND SO DID THE BOY
THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH
THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
THAT'S WHY I FEEL THAT I DESERVE A PART OF WHAT YOU FIND
FROM ATOP ITS WALLS ONE CAN CATCH A GLIMPSE OF AFRICA
AND TOMORROW HIS ENEMY WOULD ALSO BE A PART OF THAT SOUL
HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
ANOTHER TRICK THE BOY THOUGHT
THEY ALL COMPLAIN THEY'RE PRACTICALLY WORKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT
THE SPACE STATION ROCKED VIOLENTLY DUE TO THE INTENSE PRESSURE WAVE FROM THE AIRLOCK FAILURE
I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO ON
HOW ABOUT THAT ONE THERE
ADAM IS A CROOK
BUT NOW THE SOUNDS INSIDE HAD STOPPED
IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW
HTML IS NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
UPON RETURNING TO THE WISE MAN HE RELATED IN DETAIL EVERYTHING HE HAD SEEN
SOMETHING INSIDE THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREWING THE TOP
SUPPOSE THERE WAS A SHANE YORK AND HE WALKED INTO THIS OFFICE
NEXT YOU'LL WANT TO ENUMERATE TABS SO YOU CAN QUICKLY JUMP BETWEEN THEM
I'M JUST A MAN WHO WANDERS THE DESERT AND KNOWS THE STARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST
HE DIDN'T KNOW THE MAN YET BUT HIS PRACTICED EYE WOULD RECOGNIZE HIM WHEN HE APPEARED
WHERE DID EVERYTHING GO
I HAVE THE DIET OF A KID WHO FOUND TWENTY DOLLARS
MAKES ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR
WHAT'S SO DEPRESSING ABOUT THAT
THOSE WOMEN ARE ALL CARD SHARKS DON'T BE FOOLED
THE BOY BEGAN AGAIN TO READ HIS BOOK BUT HE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO CONCENTRATE
AND HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE DESERT THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM TO THE WOMAN HE LOVED
TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR DREAM SAID THE WOMAN
TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
I NEVER KNEW GRANDMA TO BE SO DETERMINED BEFORE
WITHOUT THE DATASET THE ARTICLE IS USELESS
THE WHOLE TOWN'S IN AN UPROAR
SINCE THE MINER HAD SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO HIS DESTINY THE OLD MAN DECIDED TO BECOME INVOLVED
A DROUGHT HIT WESTERN EUROPE
THE TERROR WAS PALPABLE
THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
WHO COULD HAVE PREDICTED THAT
THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK TO THE TOWN AGAIN TO GET HELP
THE PINK LOVE HEART KEYRING GLOWED
YOUR LUCK'S NOT WITH YOU NOW
I FELT A CHILL DOWN MY SPINE
THE ENGINES ROARED AS THE ROCKET LIFTED ITS PRECIOUS CARGO UP INTO THE ATMOSPHERE
THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
WHY DON'T YOU WANT ME TO SEE HIM
HER WALLS WERE COVERED WITH DARK AND SCARY SKETCHES
I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO
IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
TURNING THE AIR CONDITIONING ON LEADS TO AN INCREASED FUEL CONSUMPTION
IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER
ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
WHEN HE WAS A CHILD THAT MAN WANTED TO TRAVEL TOO
THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
IF ONLY WE COULD SEE IT
YOU'LL BE THE COUNSELOR OF THE OASIS
SOME STORMS ARE WORTH THE WRECKAGE
HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
TOFFEE COATED ALL THE SURFACES IT WAS DISGUSTINGLY STICKY
THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AND THEN IRRITATED
IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
PLEASE BRING MAMA BACK
THE ONE IN THERE
WE CAN'T LET THE CHRONICLE GET THE LAUGH ON US
YOU ARE WISE BECAUSE YOU OBSERVE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE THE BOY SAID
SHE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME
HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE DIDN'T
I WANT MY GARDEN TO BE FILLED WITH ROSES PETUNIAS AND PASSION FLOWERS
SHE HAD NO TEMPERATURE
THE SWORD DIDN'T FALL
THE BOY TOOK OUT URIM AND THUMMIM FROM HIS BAG
EVERYONE IS JUST STANDING BY THE BUILDING WAITING TO GET IN
WE BEAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY ON THAT STORY
AND LOOK HOW MANY THINGS THE WIND ALREADY KNEW HOW TO DO
AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
YET EACH FELT HIS HEART BEAT A BIT FASTER
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE BOY DUG AT THE PLACE HE HAD CHOSEN BUT FOUND NOTHING
ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TWO BIRDS
BUT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SELLER TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY
SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER TO BE WITH THE SHEEP WHO DON'T SAY ANYTHING
THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
AFTER WRITING A BUG REPORT ONE SHOULD REGULARLY CHECK IF SOMEONE RESPONDED
NOBODY'S GOING TO RUSH ME INTO ANYTHING
I HAVE TO SEPARATE OUT THE SULFUR
I TOLD YOU THAT YOUR DREAM WAS A DIFFICULT ONE
THE PIXEL PROBABILITIES ARE CONDITIONED ON THE MODEL STATE
BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO REALIZE YOUR DESTINY
CAN I GO NOW
THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AFFORDABLE AND COSY
LASER TAG IS A GAME QUITE SIMILAR TO PAINTBALL
I FEEL QUITE AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE ARTICLE
THAT'S TRUE THE BOY THOUGHT
SO USUALLY A KEYPRESS INSTEAD OF A CLICK IS USED
I CAN'T THINK ANY MORE
WE MISS YOU AND MISS HAVING A FRIEND LIKE YOU AND I AM SO HAPPY THAT YOU TWO GOT TO CATCH UP
AND YOU KNOW IT AS WELL AS I DO
I HOLD THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR EVERY PERSON I TAKE WITH ME
HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET HIM EXAMINED
BUT THE MARKETPLACE WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS FAR FROM HOME SO HE WEPT
AND MAYBE IT WASN'T THAT THEY WERE TEACHING ME BUT THAT I WAS LEARNING FROM THEM
HOW DID IT START
I'M GOING TO THEM
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THEIR PROBLEM
HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
THE NEWS WAS CHILLING TO SAY THE LEAST
HE'S HOME COOKING DINNER
HOW SHOULD I KNOW
I HAVEN'T ANY WATCH
I HATE TO THINK THAT I WILL HAVE TO LEAVE BUT I GUESS THATS NOT REALLY UP TO ME
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONE THAT HAS ALL THE ANSWERS
HE WAS JUST AND GOOD
THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO I'M TALKING TO ANY MORE
SHE AND THE JUDGE ARE LIKE CORNED BEEF AND CABBAGE
WHO'S GONNA GET HIM
HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM
IT RATTLED MENACINGLY
AS JENNIFER WALKED DOWN THE AISLE SHE WONDERED IF SHE HAD MADE A MISTAKE
BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN OF THEM WHO TOOK A BIT LONGER TO AWAKEN
AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
THE BOY WAS BECOMING NERVOUS
ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
BUT EVERYTHING HAD CHANGED
OTHER SERVANTS MAINTAINED THE FIRES IN THE HOOKAHS
THEY WERE LOOKING ONLY FOR GOLD HIS COMPANION ANSWERED
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE BOY WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUTH OF WHAT THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
AT THAT POINT THE OMENS WILL TELL YOU THAT YOUR TREASURE IS BURIED FOREVER
BUT CHILDREN ALWAYS SEEM TO BE ABLE TO PLAY WITH THEM WITHOUT FRIGHTENING THEM
BE SURE YOU SPELL THE NAME RIGHT
HE HAD COME TO THE TOWN ONLY TO FIND A WOMAN WHO COULD INTERPRET HIS DREAM
GIVE ME MY ROBE
IF I HAD TOLD YOU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN THE PYRAMIDS
SOMEBODY HAD RETURNED MY LOST CREDIT CARD TO THE BANK
DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HERD AT AN ABANDONED CHURCH
LOVE REQUIRED THEM TO STAY WITH THE PEOPLE THEY LOVED
AND THEY ATTACKED AN EMPTY TENT
THE GENIES WERE THE SPIRITS OF GOOD AND EVIL
VIBRATIONS OF PEACE THROUGHOUT THE TENT
THE BOY WANTED TO TAKE HER HAND
JUST ONE MORE TRY
THEN WHO'S THIS ONE
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
HE PREPARED HIMSELF A SANDWICH AND DRANK SOME HOT TEA FROM A CRYSTAL GLASS
OXYGEN IS IMPORTANT FOR US BUT SOME BACTERIA DON'T NEED IT AT ALL
THE CATERPILLAR RESPONDED WITH A NOD
YOUR FACE IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL
IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED AND I COULD HEAR A FAINT SHRIEK BEHIND THE WALLS
HEY WHAT DO YOU SAY
HE RAN HIS FINGERS SLOWLY OVER THE STONES SENSING THEIR TEMPERATURE AND FEELING THEIR SURFACES
HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD
WILMAS GONE CAT SITTING AGAIN FOR THE WEEKEND IF YOU WANT TO COME OVER
THE BOY FELT A PANG IN HIS HEART THINKING ABOUT THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE
IT'S EASY AND YET I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE HE THOUGHT
BUT AS HE SAW THEM LYING THERE ON THE GROUND ANOTHER PHRASE CAME TO HIS MIND
LUKE I AM YOUR SISTER
YOU'LL ASK ME TO WHAT
I'M GOING TO BUILD A BRIDGE A MILE LONG
WHEN THE PAN HAD COOLED THE MONK AND THE BOY LOOKED AT IT DAZZLED
BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
EVIDENTLY WE'RE THE FLOOR SHOW
FATIMA APPEARED AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TENT
BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
I THINK IT'S ABOUT BIRD HUNTING BUT NOW I CAN SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE MISINTERPRETED
I'M GOING AWAY HE SAID
THERE'S NOTHING MORE WE CAN DO TONIGHT
TRUST IN YOUR HEART BUT NEVER FORGET THAT YOU'RE IN THE DESERT
I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND
THE BOY'S NAME WAS SANTIAGO
HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEEK OUT THE OLD WOMAN FOR THIS
AREN'T YOU ALLOWED TO KISS BACK
ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY USES PAIRS OF KEYS
WHO ENGINEERED THIS GETAWAY
WHAT TIME IS IT
YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
THE ARTICLE SHOULD CONTAIN URL WHERE THE DATASET CAN BE DOWNLOADED
AT ONCE HE CONNECTED THE TWO INCIDENTS
MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR
FEBRUARY TOOK A BOOK FROM THE SHELVES
THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
IN GENERAL PEOPLE HAVE DIFFICULTIES ESTIMATING RISKS CORRECTLY
SHOOT THROUGH THE DESK
NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE TWO TRAVELERS
THE BATTLES MAY LAST FOR A LONG TIME PERHAPS EVEN YEARS
WHAT WAS THE REASON FOR THE INCREASE
MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
I CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY
I DON'T SEE A THING
DON'T YOU PUSH ME AROUND LIKE THAT
DON'T LET FACEBOOK TAKE UP ALL OF YOUR TIME
BUT ARMS CANNOT BE DRAWN UNLESS THEY ALSO GO INTO BATTLE
I'M COMING FATIMA HE SAID
NO BASELINES OR COMPARISON TO STATE OF THE ART IS PROVIDED
WITH A BAG OF MARSHMALLOWS
TELL YOUR HEART THAT THE FEAR OF SUFFERING IS WORSE THAN THE SUFFERING ITSELF
WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
HEADS POPPING BACK BEHIND DOORS
THE BOY THOUGHT OF FATIMA
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS SUFFUSED WITH THE SWEET SCENT OF SMOKE
AND IT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT LOVE
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SMELL THE WORLD
THEY SAY IT'S A FAKE
THE OMENS HAD TOLD HIM SO
THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
YOU HAVE TO CROSS THE ENTIRE SAHARA DESERT SAID THE YOUNG MAN
ALL WHO WENT THERE WERE HAPPY AT HAVING DONE SO
HE SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY LIKE THEM
I GOT TWO GIANT BUG BITES ON MY RIGHT LEG FROM LAST NIGHT AND THEY HURT
WHY DO THEY NEED GIN
ARE YOU GONNA THROW A ROCK
THE BOY WAS GETTING IRRITATED
WHO'D YOU SAY WAS GONNA GET HIM
ISN'T IT JUST BEAUTIFUL
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL
HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU GONNA CALL ME
THE BOY WAS ALSO SADDENED HIS FRIEND WAS IN PURSUIT OF HIS DESTINY
IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO TALK
I'LL TELL YOU IN A MINUTE
IT'S NOT I THE WIND SPOKE ABOUT
IT WAS JUST RIPE ENOUGH TO EAT
THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
I'M DYING FOR WHAT I BELIEVE
COACH HAS HEARD ALL ABOUT YOU
THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBAL WARS
THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW
AND THE LEADER POSTED ARMED SENTINELS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROUP
I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED
EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE
I KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE
I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER AFTER THE BOAT SAILS
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME UNDER ONE CONDITION
HE WALKED SLOWLY THROUGH THE MARKET
IS IT A DEAL OR ISN'T IT
TODAY'S WORLD IS FULL OF COMMERCIALS
SOMETHING'S THE MATTER WITH DADDY
THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ROMANTIC
OF COURSE HE'S COMING BACK HERE
SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALEX PRETTY WELL
SHE REFILLED HER VESSEL AND LEFT
YOU'RE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY MY FATHER WAS NO BUSINESS MAN
I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING
THE BOY WAS SAD AS HE LEFT HER THAT DAY
AND I'M AFRAID WE WANT IT BACK
I DON'T BELIEVE IT
YOUR HUSBAND MUST HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT HURRY
WHAT A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY
JUST USE THE PHONE
YESTERDAY I WAITED FOREVER FOR THE SUBWAY TRAIN
SOMEPLACE YOU COULD HAVE PUT IT
MIND IF I SIT DOWN
THE WIND HAS MANY NAMES
THE ACTOR'S AUTHENTIC FACIAL EXPRESSION WAS CONVINCING THE JURY
WELL USUALLY I LEARN MORE FROM MY SHEEP THAN FROM BOOKS HE ANSWERED
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS THAT HE COVERED IN AN HOUR
I WANT TO SEE HIM DO IT SAID THE CHIEF
ALTHOUGH SEARCHING IN BINARY SEARCH TREES IS EFFICIENT YOU WON'T FIND ANY FRUITS IN THERE
IT'S CANDICE NOW ON LONG DISTANCE FROM WASHINGTON
HE DECANTED THE WINE AND BEGAN TO RECOUNT THE DISTURBING STORY HE HAD BEEN TOLD
THEY'RE NOT MY SHEEP ANYMORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTALGIA
BUT HE HAD TO MOVE ON
THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
CAUSE YOU KNOW HOW POLITICIANS ARE
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO LEAVE ME ALONE
IT'S TRUE LIFE REALLY IS GENEROUS TO THOSE WHO PURSUE THEIR DESTINY THE BOY THOUGHT
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME
I WOULDN'T LIVE IN IT AS A GHOST
LIGHTHOUSES IN A FOGGY WORLD
YOU CAN TRY USING AN EYE TRACKER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BUT THE PRECISION ISN'T QUITE HIGH ENOUGH
THEY WERE MEN OF THE DESERT AND THEY WERE FEARFUL OF SORCERERS
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
THE BOY KNEW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE CITY
STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
IF THAT GUY LAYS AN EGG
WHAT WAS ALL THAT
I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
I'LL JUST WATCH HIM HE SAID TO HIMSELF
HOW THEY MANAGED TO IMPROVISE AT SUCH SHORT NOTICE SHE'LL NEVER KNOW
DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
THE EXPERIMENTS ARE UNCONVINCING
IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
YOU WANT THE MOON
THANKS FOR DROPPING AROUND
TWO MORE MONTHS PASSED AND THE SHELF BROUGHT MANY CUSTOMERS INTO THE CRYSTAL SHOP
IN ANY CASE IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'VE LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRICE
HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM
HE KNEW HE WAS STRONGER THAN HIS FRIEND
TRYING TO IMPROVE THE WORLD BY JUMPING UP AND DOWN
IN ONE HE HAD READ THAT MANY YEARS AGO A FAMOUS ARABIAN ALCHEMIST HAD VISITED EUROPE
MY KEYCHAIN IS HEAVY AND AWKWARD TO CARRY IN MY POCKET
YOU CAN HEAR OUT OF IT
HE'S LOOKING FOR YOU
HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NEWS
I'M GOING TO MISS ANNIE
THE CRIMINALS TAUNTED THE POLICE OFFICERS AND PRISON GUARDS
THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT TO THE MONK
MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
YOU'RE PROBABLY WEAK FROM HUNGER
HANG ON FOR A SECOND
IT WAS RISING SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY OUT OF THE CYLINDER
THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
SOMETHING HAPPENS HERE YOU'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER LATER ON
BUT THEY'RE SOMEBODY'S CHILDREN
HOW IS MOZILLA GOING TO HANDLE AMBIGUITIES LIKE QUEUE AND CUE
YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
LOVE IS THE FORCE THAT TRANSFORMS AND IMPROVES THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
THE VISION VANISHED IMMEDIATELY BUT IT HAD SHAKEN HIM
THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
IT WAS A COBRA WHOSE VENOM COULD KILL A PERSON IN MINUTES
IT WAS ALMOST AS IF HER LIFE HAD BEEN DELETED
I'LL GIVE IT A DRINK
YOU'LL WEAKEN WHEN YOU SEE THAT LITTLE JEZEBEL
HE DISAPPEARED INTO THE TENT
HE PICKED UP THE TWO STONES AND PUT THEM BACK IN HIS POUCH
BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
THERE WASN'T MUCH IMPETUS TO FINISH OUR CHORES
THAT'S TOO FAR FROM THE BEDROOM
SOMETIMES THEIR CARAVAN MET WITH ANOTHER
HITTING THE DELETE AND ESCAPE KEYS DID NOTHING
THE ITALIAN GOT HER WORDS MIXED UP
ONE IS LOVED BECAUSE ONE IS LOVED
IT'S NOT WHAT ENTERS MEN'S MOUTHS THAT'S EVIL SAID THE ALCHEMIST
I'M HUNTING WITH MY FALCON THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SENT DOWN FOR
HOW ARE THE WEIGHTS COMPUTED
THESE ARE THE SPIES SAID ONE OF THE MEN
FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
THEN A MAN APPROACHED
I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
THEY JUST WON'T LET ANYBODY TALK POLITICS TO THEM
IT WAS BUNCHED UP AND HE HAD HARDLY THOUGHT OF IT FOR A LONG TIME
USED TO HUNT RABBITS THERE MYSELF
AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
ONCE TO THE THIEF AND ONCE TO THE GENERAL
LOTS OF SHEPHERDS PASSED THROUGH SELLING THEIR WOOL
AND FIND OUT WHERE THE NEAREST TELEGRAPH OFFICE IS
THIS IS THE MAYOR
THE ALCHEMIST PROBABLY ALREADY KNEW ALL THAT
I WISH IT WERE AS SIMPLE AS THAT
THE BOY PICKED UP HIS POUCH AND PUT IT WITH HIS OTHER THINGS
ONLY WE CALL THEM AGENTS
THEY WERE RELIEVED AND HAPPY
A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
WE'VE STILL GOT TWO BUCKS LEFT
ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
HE BROUGHT SIX SHEEP WITH HIM
WHY CAN'T YOU BE SERIOUS
THEY ALSO BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THEY KNEW A BETTER WAY THAN OTHERS HAD
HE STOOD SILENT AND MOTIONLESS REGARDING ME
SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
SOME DO COME BACK
THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES
AND NOW IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD BE BACK IN THAT SAME VILLAGE
I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK WHICH WAS EMBEDDED IN THE GROUND
HOW LONG IS IT
AT THAT POINT IN THEIR LIVES EVERYTHING IS CLEAR AND EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE
AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
AND I TOLD HARRY I THOUGHT I'D BE BORED TO DEATH
WE DONT WANT HIM
WE MUST BE GOOD
THE ENGLISHMAN HAD BEEN PROFOUNDLY IMPRESSED BY THE STORY
AS HE LOOKED AT THE STONES HE FELT RELIEVED FOR SOME REASON
THEY BEGAN TO RIDE OUT OVER THE SANDS WITH THE MOON LIGHTING THEIR WAY
THEY BEGIN CREEPING UP ON YOU TRYING TO SELL YOU SOMETHING
THE HIGH HUMIDITY IS MAKING ME SWEAT
THE LITTLE GIRL WANTED TO HAVE A BALLOON BUT WAS TOO SHY TO ASK
THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
AND IT GOES FOR YOU TOO
WE'LL LEAVE TOMORROW BEFORE SUNRISE WAS THE ALCHEMIST'S ONLY RESPONSE
THE FACT THAT THE TWO HOURS HAD STRETCHED INTO AN ENTIRE YEAR DIDN'T MATTER
I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
THE COMPARISON TO OTHER WORKS ON DIFFERENT DATABASES IS STILL PROBLEMATIC
THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
THE BOY FELT ILL AND TERRIBLY ALONE
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU TWO GUYS
DO YOU READ ME
WE LIT THE LANTERN AND WALKED OVER TO HIS HOUSE
THE BOY WAS SUDDENLY HAPPY TO BE THERE AT THE WAREHOUSE
I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
AND I'M GOING TO BUILD THINGS
LOOK AT THE POLICY I GAVE HIM
DIDN'T YOU TELL HER
THIS IS MY LAST CHANCE
TO DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY I MUST HAVE NO FEAR OF FAILURE
LET'S GO AND HAVE SOME LUNCH SAID THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
WHEN I HAD MY SHEEP I WAS HAPPY AND I MADE THOSE AROUND ME HAPPY
ITS SATURDAY ITS HOT AND I REALLY WANT TO TRY THE DRY RAMEN
WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
EVERY SEARCH BEGINS WITH BEGINNER'S LUCK
THE SIMUM BLEW THAT DAY AS IT HAD NEVER BLOWN BEFORE
I'LL GET IT FOR YOU
WE SPEAK OF THEM ONLY TO CHILDREN
AIDING AN ESCAPED CRIMINAL
IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
I FORGOT MY HAT
OF COURSE IT IS
IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
BUT YOU ARE IN THE DESERT
WHO'S THE TEN FOR
BUT BAKERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN SHEPHERDS
I'LL RETURN JUST AS YOUR FATHER CAME BACK TO YOUR MOTHER HE SAID
THEY SEEMED TO LAUGH AT HIM AND HE LAUGHED BACK HIS HEART BURSTING WITH JOY
THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
BUT THE BOY KNEW THAT HE WAS REFERRING TO FATIMA
MANY PEOPLE IN BERKSHIRE SURREY AND MIDDLESEX MUST HAVE SEEN IT
HE MUST BE DISGUISED TO AVOID ENCOUNTERS WITH THIEVES
WHAT'S SHE DOING OVER HERE
EVERYTHING LOOKED DIFFUSE AFTER SHE TOOK THE NARCOTIC
FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
WHO IS IT FROM
I'LL ALWAYS LET YOU DOWN
SEND THOSE OTHER PEOPLE IN
WHAT'S SHE UP TO
HE DECIDED TO STAY RIGHT THERE AND AWAIT HIS RETURN
TOO BAD I COULDN'T SEE THIS GUY FIRST
WHO IS YOUR FAVOURITE AUTHOR
AS WAS MECCA FOR THE MERCHANT
THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON
HE RESTARTED HIS EFFORTS FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME
THEY WERE IN AN IMMENSE SETTING SURROUNDED BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SPEAKING A STRANGE LANGUAGE
THERE'S THE CITY HALL TOWER I'M SUPPOSED TO VISIT
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM
AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
THAT'S NOT MY MONEY
THE SUN WAS TURNED INTO A GOLDEN DISK
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE TO ME HAD I ONLY LOOKED UP AS IT PASSED
HE'S INSANE OR DRUNK OR SOMETHING
ARE YOU GOING TO GO TO JULIA'S
IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
I'LL WORK ALL NIGHT UNTIL DAWN AND I'LL CLEAN EVERY PIECE OF CRYSTAL IN YOUR SHOP
BETTER BRING ME A GLASS OF MILK
THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE ELDERS
THE POLICE FINALLY MANAGE TO GET HIM OUT OF THE PARK
YOU CAN'T SEE THE PLANET WITH THE NAKED EYE
IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY BEGINNER'S LUCK
GOTTA BE GENTLE TO SUIT ME
YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
THAT'S THE WAY IT ALWAYS IS SAID THE OLD MAN
THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING
COMPILING THE LINUX KERNEL CAN BE TIME CONSUMING
HE WANTED TO FORGET ABOUT THE VISION AND RETURN TO HIS MEDITATION
HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
THIS IS CHRISTMAS EVE
THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
THIS PUTS ME IN A PECULIAR HOLE
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE MISTAKEN
HE WASN'T ASKING FOR HELP
YOU'D BETTER GET YOUR FRIENDS
WATCH OUT FOR HIS VENOM THE BOY SAID
I TOLD YOU I CAN'T USE YOUR COLUMN ANY MORE
IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
LET ME SEE IT
THEN WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE HE HASN'T AT LEAST CALLED UP
I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
THEN SHE TOOK BOTH OF HIS HANDS IN HERS AND BEGAN QUIETLY TO PRAY
I'VE GOT THE PARTY HERE
YOU'RE IN LUCK YOU TWO THE FAT ARAB SAID
COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
THE THREE FELL SILENT
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
KEEP YOUR SHIRT ON
I WON'T SHUT UP
THE MEN OF THE DESERT WERE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THAT WIND
AND I THINK IT'S TERRIFIC
THE NURSE WADDLED AROUND THE WARD
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE
IT'S GONNA PUT OUR CITY ON THE MAP
THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
HIS SOUL MUST BE TOO PRIMITIVE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS HE THOUGHT
THEY WERE KNOWN AS SEERS AND THEY WERE HELD IN FEAR BY WOMEN AND THE ELDERLY
WE SHOWED UP AND GAVE  MINUTE SPEECHES EACH
I'M ALREADY USED TO THE WAY THINGS ARE
STORM INCREASING OVER THE ROCKIES
BUT FINALLY THE MERCHANT APPEARED AND ASKED THE BOY TO SHEAR FOUR SHEEP
VICKY WANTED TO NOT MAKE A SPECTACLE OF HERSELF
I'M A SUCKER FOR THIS COUNTRY
HIS EYES FILLED WITH TEARS AS HE SPOKE OF THE PROPHET
LOOK WHERE YOU'RE GOING
MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
IT WAS GLARINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND
BUT I DIDNT THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
LET'S HAVE YOUR STORY
WHEN YOU ARE LOVED YOU CAN DO ANYTHING IN CREATION
JUST AS YOUR GRANDFATHER TAUGHT YOU
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS TALK TO HIM
THE BASKETBALL BOUNCED OFF HIS SHIELD OF TITANIUM
LIKE EVERYBODY LEARNS HE SAID
IT CONSIDERS THE HORIZONTAL DIMENSION AS TIME
TODAY I UNDERSTAND SOMETHING I DIDN'T SEE BEFORE EVERY BLESSING IGNORED BECOMES A CURSE
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO
WHAT ARE YOU DOING AROUND HERE
SHOW ME SOME GRATITUDE
THAT'S WHY I WAS SENT DOWN HERE
ABOUT HOW WEALTHY WOULD YOU SAY
ISNT THIS A PARAMETER OF THE METHOD
SOMETHING BRIGHT REFLECTED FROM HIS CHEST WITH SUCH INTENSITY THAT THE BOY WAS MOMENTARILY BLINDED
FOLK IS NOT MY FAVORITE MUSIC GENRE
BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
THE SNAKE SLITHERED TOWARD THE SHADED BOULDERS UNDER THE CLIFF
HE SAID THAT EVERYTHING HAS ITS OWN DESTINY
PUT DOWN THAT CHAIR
THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
YOU HAVE BEEN STOPPING ME
THE WAR IS GOING TO END SOMEDAY THE GIRL SAID
I HOPE SOME OF THE LINES MAKE YOU SMILE
AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
GIVEN ONLY THE PUBLIC KEY IT IS VERY HARD TO COMPUTE THE PRIVATE ONE
THERE WERE RAISED VOICESAND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON
WHERE YOU GOT HIM
MY MOTHER JUST CALLED YOU
HE WANDERED FOR A WHILE KEEPING THE DATE PALMS OF THE OASIS WITHIN SIGHT
MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE THEY MOVED AROUND SO MUCH
TURKEY FOR THANKSGIVING
I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
YOU GOT YOUR SEA LEGS YET
HE HAD SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT IN TARIFA THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO INTERPRETED DREAMS
I'M A SUCKER FOR IT
EXCUSE YOU FOR WHAT
AND ABOVE ALL DON'T FORGET TO FOLLOW YOUR DESTINY THROUGH TO ITS CONCLUSION
THE TELLER DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH CHANGE
THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
IT WAS A PLEASANT CHANGE FROM TALKING TO HIS SHEEP
I GOT DOCTOR BILLS TO PAY
ONLY CHRIS COULDN'T WAIT QUITE AS LONG AS THE OTHERS
YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF HET DESERT
THE CONQUERED HALF OF THE WORLD ON HER HORSE'S BACK
NEVER GIVE UP
I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
WHAT HAD BEEN NEXT TO HIM FIVE MINUTES AGO WAS NOW AT THE OTHER SIDE
BUT JUST BEFORE LUNCHTIME A BOY STOPPED IN FRONT OF THE SHOP
THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
LET'S STOP THIS ANOTHER COMMANDER SAID
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT LOVE
WITHOUT RESPONDING THE GUARD ENTERED THE TENT WHERE HE REMAINED FOR SOME TIME
IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
I WON A FLOWER
IT MUST BE SOME KIND OF A GAG
DID YOU SEE HIS PICTURE ON THE COVER OF TIME
THE ALCHEMIST REMOVED THE PAN FROM THE FIRE AND SET IT ASIDE TO COOL
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GET HURT
THE ENGLISHMAN ASKED IF THEY WERE IN DANGER
THAT BRINGS YOU GOOD LUCK FOR TEN YEARS
WHERE DO YOU LIVE SHOUTED THE BOY AS THE HORSEMAN RODE AWAY
AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHAT THESE THINGS COST OVER HERE
REPLACE THE TS IN TIM TEBOW'S NAME WITH ANY OTHER CONSONANT TO GET A STAR WARS CHARACTER
THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD BEEN DISTRACTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SWORD
AS THE SUN ROSE THE MEN BEGAN TO BEAT THE BOY
HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
SOMEWHERE YOU ARE HOLDING THE PERSON I LOVE THE BOY SAID
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH A HORSE
WHERE DID HE KEEP HIS MONEY
THE LIST WAS FRIGHTENINGLY EXTENSIVE
MY FRIEND BOUGHT ALL THE OTHER SHEEP IMMEDIATELY
MUCH BETTER SAID THE OLD MAN
AN HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
I WAS EXPECTING YOU
THE IMMENSE COLLECTION OF PEOPLE AND ANIMALS BEGAN TO TRAVEL FASTER
THERE WERE JUST DRAWINGS CODED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSCURE TEXTS
WHAT DO THEY WANT
THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
HE TOOK BACK HIS BOOKS AND PACKED THEM AWAY AGAIN IN THEIR BAGS
FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
ONCE YOU GET INTO THE DESERT THERE'S NO GOING BACK SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
THERE IS NO WINE IN THIS COUNTRY THE YOUNG MAN SAID
THIS IS FOR YOU
IF YOU KNOW YOUR HEART WELL IT WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO THAT TO YOU
I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR VOICE TO PROJECT COMMON VOICE
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
I GUESS I WAS HOMESICK
I HAVEN'T WON MY WINGS YET
AREN'T WE GODLIKE
SPEAK TO THE HAND THAT WROTE ALL SAID THE SUN
THAT'S NOT SO BAD
IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
THEY PLAY DUETS TOGETHER
SHE SET IT ON THE SHELF AND THERE IT STAYED
HER HEIGHT HELPED HER WITH HER FIGHTING
YOU'D BETTER START RIGHT NOW
SHE FELT LIKE A WEAKLING IN COMPARISON TO HER NEWBORN DAUGHTER
THAT'S WHAT I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY
I'M TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING BEFORE THOSE REPORTERS GET BACK
IT'S PRACTICALLY UP THERE NOW
NOW I WANT YOU TO SIGN THIS AGREEMENT
HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
WHAT DID SHE SAY
WHY DON'T WE SEARCH THEIR ROOMS
WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE EMERALD TABLET THE BOY WANTED TO KNOW
I ALMOST DROPPED HIM
WHAT A WONDERFUL WEATHER
LAURA TOOK OUT A CIGARETTE AND PLACED IT IN HER MOUTH
HE PUT A SIGN ON THE DOOR AND THEY WENT TO A SMALL CAFE NEARBY
BILL DECIDED THAT MANAGEMENT SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS INCIDENT
LOTS OF PLACES SELL TEA AROUND HERE THE MERCHANT SAID
I THOUGHT SURE YOU'D REMEMBER ME
THE RIVER BABBLED INANELY TO ITSELF
GET A LOAD OF THIS
IT'S STILL SOPPING WET
NOW LET'S SEE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU PROTEST
WHAT BOAT YOU SAILING ON
I DON'T KNOW WHO ANYBODY IS ANY MORE
THEY MADE THE BOY CONTINUE DIGGING BUT HE FOUND NOTHING
THAT WAS THE LAW OF HOSPITALITY
HIS NEW FRIEND PUSHED THE OWNER ASIDE AND PULLED THE BOY OUTSIDE WITH HIM
I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY ETHICAL READING OTHER PEOPLE'S STUFF
GOATS ALWAYS HAVE A BETTER VIEW
HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
THREE DAYS FROM NOW HE WOULD BE WITH THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
IF WHAT ONE FINDS IS MADE OF PURE MATTER IT WILL NEVER SPOIL
THE CARAVAN BEGAN TO TRAVEL DAY AND NIGHT
FOR SOME REASON WE WERE BLOCKED FROM ENTERING
I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
MUST HAVE BEEN THAT JUMP IN THE COLD WATER
MY NAME'S PETE DAVIS
THREE CHEERS FOR ADEN CHRISTOPHER
NOW LEAVE US ALONE SAID THE BOY TO THE YOUNG ARAB
I'D BETTER SEE WHAT HE'S UP TO
THIS SAMANTHA TOMMY MOVEMENT COSTS YOU A FORTUNE
MY FATHER FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM
THE NEARBY CITY OF CEUTA HAD GROWN FASTER THAN TANGIER AND BUSINESS HAD FALLEN OFF
HOW'D YOU HAPPEN TO FALL IN
HAVE A GOOD TRIP
SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
NO SENSE MESSING UP THE STREETS
THE TEENAGERS PUT ON RED HOODIES FOR THEIR ANNUAL TOBOGGAN RUN
ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
WE MUST STAY HIDDEN
THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN
WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT
BUT HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
THE BOY DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PYRAMIDS
MAYBE THESE DESERT BIRDS COULD EXPLAIN TO HIM THE MEANING OF LOVE WITHOUT OWNERSHIP
WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING
THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
IT'S TRUE THAT EVERYTHING HAS ITS DESTINY BUT ONE DAY THAT DESTINY WILL BE REALIZED
THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
DARREN NEVER SAW A BOTTLE TILL HE WAS SIX MONTHS OLD
THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
THE BOY LOOKED AROUND FOR THE OVENS AND OTHER APPARATUS USED IN ALCHEMY BUT SAW NONE
LET ME SPEAK TO HER
HIS GRANDFATHER WAS A SNAKE
YOUR MOTHER AND I TALKED IT OVER HALF THE NIGHT
OF COURSE THIS ONLY REDUCES THE SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM
HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SCHEDULE OF EVERYONE WHO PASSED
THERE'S NOT A REASON ON EARTH WHY YOU SHOULD
IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEER
IF YOU CAN CONCENTRATE ALWAYS ON THE PRESENT YOU'LL BE A HAPPY MAN
AT LEAST SHE KNOWS HOW TO BEHAVE AT FUNERALS
HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
WE'VE CERTAINLY BEEN IN SOME SWEET JAMS
HE'S TRYING TO TRICK YOU AGAIN
AND HE GETS IT RIGHT AWAY
IN ORDER TO FIND THE TREASURE YOU WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THE OMENS
SHE'S A WONDERFUL PERSON
IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED
SO YOU KNOW ABOUT LOVE THE BOY SAID
HE DIDN'T SEDUCE HER WITH HIS WORDS BUT WITH SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES THAT'S THE TRICK
SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
HE'S ON THE WAY
YOU KNOW I'D TELL YOU IF I HAD IT
BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT
NEXT INSTALL AN EXTENSION THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ADD CUSTOM PYTHON COMMANDS
EVERYONE HAS HIS OR HER OWN WAY OF LEARNING THINGS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
WOULDN'T DO ANY GOOD
THAT'S WHY I'M QUITTING
AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
PLEASE DON'T CRY
THE REPORT WAS LARGELY SCATHING
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE COMMOTION IN THAT LOCKER ROOM
AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
IT MAY BE THE GASES OF THE FIRING THAT CAUSED THE MARTIANS INCONVENIENCE
THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH THE BOY THOUGHT RUEFULLY
SOMETIMES THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO HOLD BACK THE RIVER
WHAT A LOAD OF TRASH SARAH OPINED
THE TEACHER THOUGHT THAT HE'D TAUGHT HIMSELF ALL HE COULD
THE ALCHEMISTS SPENT YEARS IN THEIR LABORATORIES OBSERVING THE FIRE THAT PURIFIED THE METALS
THE BOY OFFERED HIS BOTTLE HOPING THAT THE OLD MAN WOULD LEAVE HIM ALONE
IT WAS A LITMUS TEST
THE ACHIEVED RESULTS ARE FAR BEHIND THE STATEOFTHEART IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
I COULDN'T WORK IN THE CITY
I WANT TO SEE THAT MAP COVERED BEFORE WE GET THROUGH
I THINK YOU'RE A GREAT GUY
YOU HAVE A MANIA FOR SIMPLIFYING EVERYTHING ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN IRRITATED
NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CANDIDATES
HE TOLD FATIMA THAT AT THEIR NEXT MEETING
THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS
BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR ALUMNI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS
I'D KNOW THAT VOICE ANYWHERE
I WANT THEM BOTH ARRESTED
THE NAVY'S GOING TO FLY FATHER HOME THIS AFTERNOON
I'LL TALK TO YOU TONIGHT
IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS WINE HE HAD EVER TASTED
THE LITTLE GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM THE CITY DISPERSED
WE WANT TO SELL HANDMADE CHUKKA BOOTS IN THAT FOOD TRUCK
LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
THE ALCHEMIST KNOCKED ON THE GATE OF THE MONASTERY
HOW LONG SINCE WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER
GET THE GOVERNOR ON THE PHONE
IS DADDY IN TROUBLE
IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
BACON PANCAKES AND MAPLE SYRUP IS A HEARTY START TO ANY DAY
AND YOU MARRIED HER
YOU HAVE HELPED ME THE MAN CONTINUED TO PREPARE HIS TEA SAYING NOTHING
FRANK WAS DYING SO THEY WERE FORCED TO LEAVE HIM
WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
THE CEILING COLLAPSED INWARDS
THE INFIDELS HAD AN EVIL LOOK ABOUT THEM
DIDN'T I TELL YOU NEVER TO COME PANHANDLING AROUND HERE
I'LL JUST GO UPSTAIRS AND SEND IT OVER WITH A MESSENGER
I HOPE IT WORKS
BERLIN CAN BE SO LOVELY THIS TIME OF YEAR
AND HERE'S FIFTY DOLLARS ON ACCOUNT
WE KNOW THAT AND WE ARE USED TO IT
THEN I DON'T GET PAID
THESE ARE NOT CAMELS
THE BOY KNEW AND WAS NOW WORKING TOWARD IT
WHAT'S THE GOOD OF ARGUING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T EXIST
IT WAS A STRANGE FURNACE FUELED BY FIREWOOD WITH A TRANSPARENT FLASK HEATING ON TOP
ONE MUST PREPARE FOR IT
ARE YOU ENJOYING LONDON
LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SANDS
THEY FORGOT THAT LEAD COPPER AND IRON HAVE THEIR OWN DESTINIES TO FULFILL
THE WIND BEGAN TO BLOW AGAIN
THEY RODE FOR THE ENTIRE DAY
I'M BEGINNING TO REALIZE THAT
THE CHAIR HAD LEATHER UPHOLSTERY
WHAT DOES THAT GET US
THE PLASTIC BARRIER SHATTERED
THE CHARCOAL BURNED AWAY TO WHITE ASH
DID YOU SEE THE GARDEN THAT IT TOOK THE MASTER GARDENER TEN YEARS TO CREATE
WHEN HE SPEAKS IN OUR LANGUAGE I CAN INTERPRET WHAT HE HAS SAID
THE SCALE MODEL OF THE ARCHITECTS PLANS SAT AT THE CENTER OF THE CONFERENCE ROOM
IT'S A SIMPLE STORY
LICORICE IS A BLACK CHEWY FOOD
ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS CAN DO SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR
WHAT IS LOVE THE DESERT ASKED
THE SNAKE FOUGHT FRANTICALLY MAKING HISSING SOUNDS THAT SHATTERED THE SILENCE OF THE DESERT
I'LL TAKE MINE NOW
DON'T BE MORE CATHOLIC THAN THE POPE
I AIN'T SEEN HIM FOR A WEEK
WHO DO YOU WANT
A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN UNCOVERED
THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE MAN'S CLOTHING WAS STRANGE
THEY PLACED THE SYMBOLS OF THE PILGRIMAGE ON THE DOORS OF THEIR HOUSES
HOW DO YOU STOP THIS THING
DON'T YOU KNOW THERE ARE NINE JOBS WAITING FOR THIS GUY
THEN SHE FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER AND LEFT
AND IF IT IS
THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT FLAGS UP THERE NOW
THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
VENUS IS FAR TOO HOT FOR EXPLORATION
MAY I GO IN AND SEE HIM
I WONDER WHAT'S EATING THAT OLD MONEY GRUBBING BUZZARD ANYWAY
